### **Project Plan: Evaluating of various Sentiment Analysis methods using Amazon Reviews**

#### **Objective**
To perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using:
1. Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization.
2. A pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the dataset.

The project aims to compare the performance of these two approaches and evaluate their trade-offs.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup**

**Task 1.1: Environment Setup** Functional coding environment with necessary libraries.
- Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook
- Install the following libraries:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling.
  - `scikit-learn` for Naive Bayes and TF-IDF.
  - `huggingface`, `transformers` for RoBERTa.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization.

### **Phase 2: Data Preparation** 
Cleaned and preprocessed dataset split into training, validation, and test sets.

**Task 2.1: Load Dataset**
- Use the HuggingFace `datasets` library to load the Amazon reviews dataset.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure (e.g., `text`, `label`).

**Task 2.2: Clean Data**
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Perform text preprocessing (e.g., remove punctuation, convert to lowercase).

**Task 2.3: Split Data**
- Divide the dataset into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.


### **Phase 3: Naive Bayes with TF-IDF**
Trained Naive Bayes model and performance metrics.

**Task 3.1: Vectorization**
- Use `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to convert text data into numerical features.

**Task 3.2: Train Naive Bayes Model**
- Train a `MultinomialNB` model using the TF-IDF features and training labels.

**Task 3.3: Evaluate Naive Bayes Model**
- Use the validation and test datasets to evaluate performance.
- Calculate metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Visualize performance using a confusion matrix.

### **Phase 4: Fine-Tuning RoBERTa**
Fine-tuned RoBERTa model and performance metrics.
**Task 4.1: Tokenization**
- Use the `RobertaTokenizer` to tokenize the text data into the format required by RoBERTa.

**Task 4.2: Fine-Tune RoBERTa**
- Fine-tune the pre-trained RoBERTa model on the training dataset using Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API or custom PyTorch code.
- Monitor performance on the validation set during training.

**Task 4.3: Evaluate RoBERTa Model**
- Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the test dataset using the same metrics.


### **Phase 5: Comparison and Analysis**
Comparative analysis report and visualization.
**Task 5.1: Performance Comparison**
- Compare the performance metrics of both models side by side.
- Highlight strengths and weaknesses of each approach (e.g., speed vs. accuracy).

**Task 5.2: Result Analysis**
- Identify patterns or trends in the results.
- Discuss possible reasons for differences in performance.
